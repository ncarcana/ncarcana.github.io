		<h2>What are Chakras?</h2>
			<blockquote cite="https://iarp.org/chakra-basics/" id="what">
				<p>The term chakra is Sanskrit for “wheel.” Chakras are depicted as spinning, colored wheels of energy. For millenia, chakras have been recognized as essential to life. <br>
				Chakras, by definition, are energy centers within the human body that help to regulate all its processes, from organ function to to the immune system and emotions. Seven chakras are positioned throughout your body, from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Each chakra has its own associated color and aligns with specific functions in your body that help make you human.<br>
				It is said that we can have up to 80,0000 chakras positioned in our bodies but we only commonly count the main 7. In various traditions chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions. They are visualized as lotuses with a different number of petals in every chakra. <img src="chak.jpg" class="img1"></p>

      		<h2>The History</h2>
		<blockquote id="hist">
      		<p>Discussions about chakras originate in India around 1,500 B.C. and there is also mention of them in early Yoga scriptures, dating to circa 200 B.C. However, the West didn’t hear much about chakras until the subject was introduced in the early 20th century.<br>
      		The main text about chakras that has come to us in the West is a translation in The Serpent Power published in 1919. These texts: the Sat-Cakra-Nirupana, written by an Indian pundit in 1577, and the Padaka-Pancaka, written in the 10th century, contain descriptions of the energetic centers and related practices. The New Age movement has led to an increased interest in the West regarding chakras. Many in this movement point to a correspondence between the position and role of the chakras and those of the glands in the endocrine system. <br>
      		The seven chakras are said by some to reflect how the unified consciousness of humanity (the immortal human being or the soul), is divided to manage different aspects of earthly life (body/instinct/vital energy/deeper emotions/communication/having an overview of life/contact to God). The chakras are placed at differing levels of spiritual subtlety, with Sahasrara at the top being concerned with pure consciousness, and Muladhara at the bottom being concerned with matter, which is seen simply as crude consciousness.

			<h2>Are your Chakras balanced?</h2>

      		<p>If you ever felt "off" on the inside and didn't know what was going on, it's possible your chakras could've been off balance.Traumas, fears and ‘negative’ experiences can lead to long-term imbalances in your energy system that then manifest into challenges like insecurity, anger, stress or disease leaving us with unbalanced chakras. Chakra balancing is the process of restoring a harmonious flow of energy across the chakra system. One could balance their chakras with many various techniques. Some common ones you may already know about are yoga and meditation. There are forms of yoga and meditation specifically dedicated to balancing the chakras. While each chakra can be balanced once at a time, you can also do them all together. The point is to bring an equilibrium to mind and body<img class="img3" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKnvDNYADdLYZIQ/giphy.gif" height="400" width="600">
<br>
<strong>Reiki</strong> is a common Chakra healing method. You may have seen some examples in movies. Reiki is a spiritual practice originating from Japan that uses hands-on energy healing to support a person’s self-healing and balance. They relate to energy and how it functions in the human body. Reiki healing is a whole body healing approach that relies on the transmission of energy through the hands into the person who is the recipient. This technique restores energy balance and vitality by relieving the physical and emotional effects of unreleased stress.<br>
<img class="img3" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/KZpLkm0v6mIdNCznyS/source.gif" height="400" width="600">
<br> <strong>Pranayama</strong> is a special breathing practice also said to aid in the balancing of chakras. As you breathe, your chakras are cleansed. You’ll be directing your breath in and out of the body, at a controlled and increased rate, which should leave you in a high, trance like state as breathing is a natural relaxant for humans<br>

 <img class="img3" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pWYReekqQW72U/source.gif" height="400" width="600"> <br>
<strong>Pratyahara</strong> is the withdrawing of the mind and senses from the objects of the senses. There are various ways to remove the distraction of the senses, such as remaining still, closing the eyes, and sitting in a quiet place or using earplugs.&nbsp;It is the block of the outside and internalization of the life-force that results in the balancing of the inner chakras.<br>
<img class="img3" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YA6dmVW0gfIw8/source.gif" height="400" width="600">
With right intent, anything can your chakras back to balance. Being in nature, danicing, or even eating certain colored foods corresponding with the chakra you're trying to heal is said to help as well. Clearly, you can't just simply do these things without good and focused intent on healing. Chakras are very energetic and therefore, respond with pure and good energy.</p>
