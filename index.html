		<h2>What are Chakras?</h2>
			<blockquote cite="https://iarp.org/chakra-basics/">
				<p>The term chakra is Sanskrit for “wheel.” Chakras are depicted as spinning, colored wheels of energy. For millenia, chakras have been recognized as essential to life. <br>
				Chakras, by definition, are energy centers within the human body that help to regulate all its processes, from organ function to to the immune system and emotions. Seven chakras are positioned throughout your body, from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Each chakra has its own vibrational frequency, color, and governs specific functions that help make you, well, human.<br>
				It is said that we can have up to 33 chakras positioned in our bodies but we only commonly count 7 chakras, from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Each chakra has its own vibrational frequency, that is depicted through a specific chakra color (aligning with color spectrum ROY G BIV), and governs specific functions that help make you human. <img src="chak.jpg" class="img1"></p>

      		<h2>The History</h2>
		<blockquote>
      		<p>Discussions about chakras originate in India around 1,500 B.C. and there is also mention of them in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, dating to circa 200 B.C. However, the West didn’t hear much about chakras until the subject was introduced by Sir John Woodroffe (aka Arthur Avalon) in the early 20th century.<br> </p>
