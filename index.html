		<h2>What are Chakras?</h2>
			<blockquote cite="https://iarp.org/chakra-basics/" id="what">
				<p>The term chakra is Sanskrit for “wheel.” Chakras are depicted as spinning, colored wheels of energy. For millenia, chakras have been recognized as essential to life. <br>
				Chakras, by definition, are energy centers within the human body that help to regulate all its processes, from organ function to to the immune system and emotions. Seven chakras are positioned throughout your body, from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Each chakra has its own associated color and aligns with specific functions in your body that help make you human.<br>
				It is said that we can have up to 80,0000 chakras positioned in our bodies but we only commonly count 7 chakras. In various traditions chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions. They are visualized as lotuses with a different number of petals in every chakra. <img src="chak.jpg" class="img1"></p>

      		<h2>The History</h2>
		<blockquote id="hist">
      		<p>Discussions about chakras originate in India around 1,500 B.C. and there is also mention of them in early Yoga scriptures, dating to circa 200 B.C. However, the West didn’t hear much about chakras until the subject was introduced in the early 20th century.<br>
      		The main text about chakras that has come to us in the West is a translation in The Serpent Power published in 1919. These texts: the Sat-Cakra-Nirupana, written by an Indian pundit in 1577, and the Padaka-Pancaka, written in the 10th century, contain descriptions of the energetic centers and related practices. The New Age movement has led to an increased interest in the West regarding chakras. Many in this movement point to a correspondence between the position and role of the chakras and those of the glands in the endocrine system. <br>
      		The seven chakras are said by some to reflect how the unified consciousness of humanity (the immortal human being or the soul), is divided to manage different aspects of earthly life (body/instinct/vital energy/deeper emotions/communication/having an overview of life/contact to God). The chakras are placed at differing levels of spiritual subtlety, with Sahasrara at the top being concerned with pure consciousness, and Muladhara at the bottom being concerned with matter, which is seen simply as crude consciousness.

			<h2>Chakra healing</h2>
      		<p>If you feel off inside and don't know what going on, your chakras could be off balance. Chakra balancing is the process of restoring a harmonious flow of energy across the chakra system. One could balnce the chkaras with many various techniques. Some common ones are through pranayama (breathing methods), yoga, and meditation. While each chakra can be re-balanced separately, you can also do them all together. The point is to bring back an equilibrium in mind and body</p>
