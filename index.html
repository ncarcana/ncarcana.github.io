      		<h4>Anusara</h4>
      		<img src="Anusara.png">
      		<p>Developed by American yogi in 1997, so is fairly new to the Yoga World. The goal of Anusara is to use the physical aspect of Yoga to help one open their heart and let true inner loving-kindess out. Very spiritual.</p>
      		<h4>Ashtanga</h4>
      		<img src="ash.jpg" height="240" width="240">
      		<p>Ashtanga is more based on ancient yoga teachings and was brought to the West in 1970s. In this practice, each pose is supposed to be linked a breath. Every practice is performed with the same poses, in the same order. This one is more physically vigorous. </p>
      		<h4>Bikram</h4>
      		<img src="bikram.jpg" height="240" width="300">
      		<p>Bikram is a sweatier form of Yoga, closer to a workout, developed by Bikram Choudhury 30 years ago. Like Ashtanga, a Bikram class always follows the same sequence of poses, although Bikram poses are different from Ashtanga.</p>
      		<h4>Hatha</h4>
      		<img src="hatha.jpg" height="240" width="300">
      		<p>Hatha refers to any type of yoga that teaches posture. This style is most popular in the West. Here are your most basic introduction to an array of yoga poses, but nevertheless, you still will great afterwards.</p>
      		<h4>Hot Yoga</h4>
      		<img src="hotyoga.jpg" height="240" width="300">
      		<p>Similar to Bikram, you'll need to bring some sort of towel to Hot Yoga as you're going to sweat. The sequences between the two are similar as well but not exactly alike. The room will purposely be heated so that you will sweat profusely.</p>
      		<h4>Iyengar</h4>
      		<img src="iyengar.jpg" height="240" width="300">
      		<p>Iyengar is probably one of the more strict style of yoga. Focus is more on making sure you are aligned properly in your poses. It isn't meant for getting your heart rate up, but it is more mentally and physically challenging than you'd think.</p>
      		<h4>Restorative/Yin Yoga</h4>
      		<img src="restor.jpg" height="240" width="300">
      		<p>Restorative yoga is meant more for relaxing any anxieties or nerves you may have. Classes can have blankets and blocks to help you into more reserved poses. A good restorative session is adi to be more rejuvenating than deciding to take nap.</p>
      		<h4>Vinyasa</h4>
      		<img src="vinyasa.jpg" height="240" width="300">
      		<p>Vinyasa focuses more on fluidity, smoothly transitioning from sequence to sequence. Similar to Ashtanga, but here, no two classes are the same and provide different routines every time. </p>

		<h2>What are Chakras?</h2>
			<blockquote cite="https://iarp.org/chakra-basics/">
				<p>The term chakra is Sanskrit for “wheel.” Chakras are depicted as spinning, colored wheels of energy. For millenia, chakras have been recognized as essential to life. <br>
				Chakras, by definition, are energy centers within the human body that help to regulate all its processes, from organ function to to the immune system and emotions. Seven chakras are positioned throughout your body, from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Each chakra has its own vibrational frequency, color, and governs specific functions that help make you, well, human.<br>
				It is said that we can have up to 33 chakras positioned in our bodies but we only commonly count 7 chakras, from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Each chakra has its own vibrational frequency, that is depicted through a specific chakra color (aligning with color spectrum ROY G BIV), and governs specific functions that help make you human. </p>

      		<h2>The History</h2>
		<blockquote>
      		<p>Discussions about chakras originate in India around 1,500 B.C. and there is also mention of them in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, dating to circa 200 B.C. However, the West didn’t hear much about chakras until the subject was introduced by Sir John Woodroffe (aka Arthur Avalon) in the early 20th century. </p>
